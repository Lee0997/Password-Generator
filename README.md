This tool was designed to aid the user when creating strong passwords to secure their accounts. It does this by using core javascript function to add randomisation and customisable parameters!

To install the app locally, one would only need to open their terminal using Ctrl + ' and then proceeding to run the index file with 'node index.html' or just open the link found at the top of this README! 

# Credits

App was designed by myself @Lee0997

Characters, case-sensitivity, numbers, symbols and characters 

# Tests

Due to this being a relatively simple application, testing was only necessary within the terminal and dev tools just to check all functions were being fired off correctly.
